/**
  * @mainpage The C++ Web Framework
  *
  * ​​The C++ Web Framework (CWF) is a MVC web framework, Open Source, under MIT License, created by Herik Lima and Marcelo Eler,
  * using C++ with Qt to be used in the development of web applications. The CWF was designed to consume few computational resources,
  * such as memory and processing, and have a low response time for requests. With MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture,
  * you can create classes to take care of the business layer (Model), use CSTL (C++ Server Pages Standard Tag Library)
  * within the Web Pages to take care of data presentation (View) and use the controllers as a between the two layers (Controller).
  *
  * Because it is created in Qt, the C++ Web Framework can run on the same platforms supported by Qt:
  *
  *
  * Desktop: Linux, OS X, Windows
  * Embedded and RTOS: Linux, QNX, VxWorks, Windows
  * Mobile: Android, iOS, Windows
  *
  *
  * The CWF has only one configuration file, called CPPWeb.ini and a policy of using only C++ and Qt in the development
  * of its components in order to avoid the installation of numerous libraries to avoid conflicts, maintain multiplatform characteristics,
  * facilitate installation and keep the learning curve low in order to make web development as simple as possible, even for beginners.
